# Personal UI Challenge

# Day 1

  Basically, I decided to make at least one UI screen per day to further my capibilities in designing apps. I am doing this because I focused so much on backend that I feel I am reasonably good at it, howeover, I made little to no progress in frontend. So yeah, here's the first day of work in UI. I am going to make clones of some apps for now, until I have a good grasp to make one on my own.
